## Reflection

### First tab:
- The first tab has two interactive charts. One for the historical stock prices changes and second for monthly increase(or decrease)in stock prices for top 5 tech. companies. *(Research question)*
- Both charts are easy to understand and user can select different stocks to compare the trends and make an informed decision about his/her investments.
- Both charts have slide bar for the user to select time range to explore.
- Second chart that interacts with the first chart based on the input company selected in dropdown menu. *(implemented based on feedback on milestone1)*
- Both charts have a small intro which suggest user the purpose of these charts. *(implemented as per feedback received on milestone 1)*
- When user selects multiple companies in the dropdown menu, the second chart shows monthly price changes for all those companies. *(implemented as per feedback received on milestone 1)*


### Second tab:
- The second tab has one chart which shows the hypothetical investment value($10K) changes over the time for different companies. 
- This gives user an idea about the returns for short term and long term investment for different companies. *(Research question)*
- The second chart proposed in sketch was removed from this tab as we thought it is reduntant and showed same values in percentages. 
- All time range sliders on dashboard allow user to change both start and end time. *(incorporated as the part of feedback on mileston1)*

### Third tab
- This tab was not part of initial sketch but we added it to show user the glimpse and summary of dataset behind the dashboard.
- Idea behind this is to ensure transparency to the users who may use dashboard to make decisions. 

## Limitations
- The original dataset is limited(3 main columns), so there are only few things we can do with it.
- The dashboard is simple as of now; If we have more time, we can add more fancy widgets and themes to make it look more more professional.
