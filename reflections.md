## Reflection

### First tab:
- The first tab has two interactive charts. One for the historical stock prices changes and second for monthly increase(or decrease)in stock prices for top 5 tech. companies.
- Both charts are easy to understand and user can select different stocks to compare the trends and make an informed decision about his/her investments.
- Both charts have slide bar for the user to select time range to explore.
- Second chart that interacts with the first chart based on the input company selected in dropdown menu. (implemented based on feedback from TA)
- Both charts have a small intro which suggest user the purpose of these charts. (implemented as per TA's feedback on milestone 1)
- When user selects multiple companies in the dropdown menu, the second chart shows monthly price changes for all those companies. (implemented as per TA's feedback on milestone 1)


### Second tab:
- The second tab has one chart which hows the hypothetical investment value($10K) changes over the time for different companies based on stock price info. 
- This gives user an idea about the returns for short term and long term investment for different companies. 
- The second chart shown in sketch was removed from this tab as we thought it is reduntant and showed same values but in percentages. 
- All time range sliders on both tabs allow user to change both start and end time. (incorporated as the part of feedback from TA)

### Third tab
- This tab was not part of initial sketch but we thought of adding another tab to show the user glimpse and summary of data. 
- Idea behind this is to ensure transparency and provide summary info to the user.
