# DSCI-532_group-211_dashboards

This repository hosts the App for the stock price data from the `vega-dataset`.

### Description of the App/Dashboard

The App has two sets of charts for the users to visualize: **montly stock price history**, and **investment gain**  of five tech companies from 2001 to 2010.

- The first set of charts shows the changes in stock price of the five companies over time over the ten year period. The chart on the left allows users to interactively click on a specific stock and highlight the price line of the selected stock. Depending on the stock selection of the user, the chart on the right will change correspondingly to show the monthly percentage price change for the company selected by user.

- The second set of charts shows the changes in investment value over time and investment returns given a year range the user selects. Both charts will change based on the year range selected by user. 

**NOTE**
The chart labels and titles shown in the sketch below are based on DSCI 531 lab 4 and are solely meant for showing the dashboard prototype. This is due to the fact that we have different research questions for this project, and the labels on the  charts will change accordingly.
